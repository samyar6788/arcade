# Arcade AI Take-Home: Jewelry Image Generation Improvements

This project demonstrates concrete improvements to Stable Diffusion for generating modern, prompt-accurate jewelry images.

## Quick Start

### Environment Setup

1. **Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Hardware Requirements:**
- GPU with 8GB+ VRAM recommended (CUDA-compatible)
- CPU generation supported but slower
- At least 16GB system RAM

### Generate Sample Set

1. **Run the main notebook:**
```bash
cd notebook_or_scripts
jupyter notebook demo_improvements.ipynb
```

2. **Or run individual components:**
```python
from jewelry_improvements import ImprovedJewelryPipeline
from evaluation_metrics import ComprehensiveEvaluator

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = ImprovedJewelryPipeline()

# Generate improved image
improved_images = pipeline.generate_improved(
    prompt="channel-set diamond eternity band, 2 mm width, hammered 18k yellow gold",
    num_images=1
)
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Jewelry Terminology Embeddings
- Specialized vocabulary for jewelry terms (channel-set, threader, bezel-set, etc.)
- Context-aware descriptions for technical jewelry language
- Improved semantic understanding of jewelry-specific prompts

### 2. Modern Aesthetic Guidance
- Negative prompting system to avoid vintage/cheap aesthetics
- Positive reinforcement for contemporary design language
- Style guidance toward Mejuri/Catbird/Vrai aesthetic

### 3. Attention Weighting System
- Automatic detection and weighting of critical jewelry terms
- Enhanced attention to material specifications (14k gold, platinum, etc.)
- Balanced emphasis across prompt components

### 4. Multi-Candidate Selection
- Generate multiple candidates per prompt
- Evaluation-based selection using comprehensive metrics
- Quality optimization through comparative analysis

## Evaluation Metrics

### 1. CLIP Similarity
- Overall prompt-image alignment
- Term-specific adherence scoring
- Semantic consistency measurement

### 2. Aesthetic Quality Assessment
- Modern design criteria evaluation
- Anti-vintage pattern detection
- Composition and photography quality

### 3. Prompt Element Analysis
- Material specification adherence
- Jewelry type accuracy
- Setting style correctness

## CPU Runtime (≤10 min)

The notebook is optimized for quick CPU demonstration:
- Reduced inference steps (30 vs 50)
- Efficient model loading
- Streamlined evaluation pipeline
- Total runtime: ~8 minutes on modern CPU

## Results Summary

Expected improvements demonstrated:
- ✅ Enhanced prompt adherence for jewelry terminology
- ✅ Reduced aesthetic drift toward modern styling
- ✅ Quantitative evaluation with measurable gains
- ✅ Visual comparison showing clear improvements

## Next Steps

With additional development time:
1. Fine-tune embeddings on jewelry-specific datasets
2. Implement LoRA training for style adaptation
3. Advanced prompt engineering with syntax parsing
4. Real-time aesthetic feedback loops
5. Integration with commercial jewelry databases

## Technical Notes

- Uses Stable Diffusion 1.5 as base model
- DPM Solver scheduler for improved quality
- Mixed precision for memory efficiency
- Reproducible results with fixed seeds
