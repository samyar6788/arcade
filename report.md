# Technical Report: Jewelry Image Generation Improvements

## Approach

This solution addresses both prompt adherence and aesthetic drift through a multi-faceted enhancement pipeline built on Stable Diffusion 1.5. The core improvements include:

**Enhanced Jewelry Terminology Processing**: Created specialized embeddings that expand jewelry-specific terms with detailed technical descriptions. For example, "channel-set" becomes "channel-set (precisely aligned gemstones set in parallel grooves within the metal band)," providing the model with richer semantic context for accurate representation.

**Modern Aesthetic Guidance System**: Implemented dual-approach prompting with positive reinforcement for contemporary design language ("high-end jewelry, luxury craftsmanship, minimalist elegance") and comprehensive negative prompting to avoid vintage/cheap aesthetics ("vintage, ornate, fussy, cheap, costume jewelry, tacky").

**Attention Weighting Mechanism**: Automatically detects and weights critical jewelry terms using the (term:weight) syntax, ensuring materials, settings, and jewelry types receive appropriate attention during generation. Critical terms like "channel-set," "bezel-set," and metal specifications receive 1.3x attention weighting.

**Multi-Candidate Selection**: Generates multiple candidates per prompt and selects the highest-quality result using comprehensive evaluation metrics, ensuring optimal output selection rather than single-shot generation.

## Rationale

**Pain Point 1 (Prompt Adherence)**: Jewelry terminology often fails because standard Stable Diffusion lacks specialized vocabulary understanding. By providing explicit context for technical terms and weighting them appropriately, the model receives clearer semantic signals about specific jewelry features. The enhanced embeddings bridge the gap between common language and specialized jewelry knowledge.

**Pain Point 2 (Aesthetic Drift)**: Standard models gravitate toward training data patterns that skew vintage or low-end. The modern aesthetic guidance directly counters this bias by explicitly promoting contemporary design language while suppressing outdated styling cues. This approach shifts the aesthetic prior toward the desired Mejuri/Catbird/Vrai contemporary aesthetic.

The multi-candidate approach ensures that even if some generations drift aesthetically, the evaluation-based selection process identifies and promotes the most successful outputs.

## Evidence

**Quantitative Metrics Implementation**:

1. **CLIP Similarity Scoring**: Measures semantic alignment between generated images and prompts using CLIP embeddings. Includes both overall similarity and term-specific adherence scoring for jewelry vocabulary.

2. **Modern Aesthetic Assessment**: Evaluates images against modern jewelry criteria ("contemporary design, minimalist elegance") versus anti-patterns ("vintage, ornate, cheap"). Combines positive modern scores with inverted anti-pattern scores.

3. **Prompt Element Analysis**: Parses prompts into material, jewelry type, and setting categories, then evaluates adherence to each component separately using targeted CLIP queries.

**Expected Results**: Based on the implementation, the system should demonstrate measurable improvements in CLIP similarity (targeting +0.05-0.15 gain), aesthetic scoring (targeting +0.10-0.20 gain), and overall quality metrics (targeting +0.08-0.18 gain) across the 8 test prompts.

**Evaluation Framework**: The comprehensive evaluator provides detailed breakdown of improvements across prompt adherence, aesthetic quality, and compositional elements, enabling precise measurement of both pain point improvements.

## Next Steps

**With Additional Week**: 

1. **Fine-tuned LoRA Training**: Create jewelry-specific LoRA adapters trained on curated datasets of contemporary jewelry photography, enabling more targeted style adaptation without full model retraining.

2. **Advanced Prompt Engineering**: Implement syntax parsing to automatically restructure prompts for optimal model comprehension, including automatic term prioritization and context injection.

3. **Iterative Refinement Pipeline**: Develop feedback loops that analyze failed generations and automatically adjust prompting strategies, creating self-improving generation quality over time.

4. **Commercial Dataset Integration**: Incorporate product imagery from target brands (Mejuri, Catbird, Vrai) to better calibrate aesthetic preferences and ensure market-relevant outputs.

5. **Real-time Quality Filtering**: Implement automated quality gates that reject substandard generations before user presentation, ensuring consistent high-quality outputs.

These improvements would transition from proof-of-concept to production-ready jewelry generation system capable of meeting commercial quality standards and brand aesthetic requirements.
